# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-AES-algorithm
## Image Encryption Tool

### Overview
This Python-based application provides robust encryption and decryption capabilities for image files. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, it safeguards sensitive visual data from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

### Features
* **Strong Encryption:** Employs industry-standard cryptographic algorithms to ensure data confidentiality.
* **Efficient Performance:** Optimizes encryption and decryption processes for swift execution.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive GUI simplifies operations for users of all levels.

### System Requirements
* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04.2 (recommended)
* **Python:** Version 2.7.17
* **Libraries:** numpy (1.13.3), Pillow (9.0.0), pycryptodome (3.12.0), Tkinter

### Installation
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python-tk
   pip install numpy Pillow pycryptodome
   ```
2. **Obtain the Tool:** Download the source code and extract it to your desired location.

### Usage
* **Encryption:**
